## Xenon Stack Project

### Problem Statement

We were asked to develop an AI driven real estate solution  which would assist users in their property search , whether it be a residential property or a commercial property.


### Working

The developed application is built on top MERN tech stack utlizing the firebase for authentication , cloudinary cloud Storage for storing files , along with @asymmetrik/akin for creating a node.js compatible driven recommdation engine , further compatible with the mongoose library.


It allows users to upload their own properties as well as see others properties and view data.

With each viewing, a request is sent to the engine which tracks all the user's viewing and add's to the model , it's usage may be very raw at the beginning but it is going to improve performace by a significant margin.
